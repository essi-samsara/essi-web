        "The Road Blocker is operated by high speed hydraulic cylinders. A power pack containing an electric motor – pump assembly and an accumulator/handle for manual operation (in case of power failure) is installed up to a distance of 20 meters from the barrier in all weatherproof lockable steel casing on a concrete Base. The operation time for moving the blocker up & down can be from 2 to 6 seconds. When activated, the extremely heavy blocking segment will extend and block the entry. The average blocking height is 650 mm. With a dynamic road blocker, the barrier is 'lifted' and can therefore reach a blocking height of 850 mm. Due to the  eye-catching warning color and the warning lights the blocking segment is clearly visible to approaching vehicles which allows the vehicles to stop in good time. In the lowered position the Road Blocker is absolutely unobtrusive and flush with the road surface."
