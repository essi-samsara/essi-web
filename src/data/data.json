The operation time for moving the blocker up & down can be from 2 to 6 seconds. When activated, the extremely heavy blocking segment will extend and block the entry. The average blocking height is 650 mm. With a dynamic road blocker, the barrier is 'lifted' and can therefore reach a blocking height of 850 mm. Due to the  eye-catching warning color and the warning lights the blocking segment is clearly visible to approaching vehicles which allows the vehicles to stop in good time.
